        "description2": "In this game, familiar characters and locations are transformed into tense, eerie environments that constantly keep players on edge. Survival requires sharp observation, careful listening to audio cues, and strategic management of limited resources as threats escalate. With its atmospheric visuals, suspense-driven sound design, and mobile-optimized controls, Chaves Nightmares delivers a compelling survival horror experience that balances psychological tension with classic jump-scare thrills."

        "title": "The Game Story",
        "description1": "At the heart of Chaves Nightmares lies a chilling, unresolved mystery. Players step into the shoes of a detective tasked with investigating a long-abandoned Chaves-themed venue, the site of a tragic incident that occurred years ago. Each night, survival becomes the immediate concern, while new clues gradually unfold the dark history hidden within the location.",
        "description2": "The game eschews traditional cutscenes or explicit exposition, instead weaving its story through environmental details, subtle hints, and tense moments of silence. Players uncover the narrative by observing their surroundings, piecing together fragmented information, and interpreting context. This slow-burn approach to storytelling heightens suspense, maintaining a constant sense of tension and uncertainty throughout the experience."

        "questions": [
            {
                "q": "Any spoiler-free survival tips to last more nights?",
                "a": "If you want to survive longer without spoilers, keep these principles in mind: don't switch camera views constantly out of panic—only switch when you have a reason; establish a fixed rhythm and check key points instead of looking around randomly; and when everything seems 'normal,' that's often when you should be most alert. Each night, ask yourself where your blind spots are, which signal means immediate action, and which action—if repeated too often—will leave you with no escape. In this kind of game, victory comes from discipline, not reflex speed."
            },
            {
                "q": "Does the game have different difficulty levels?",
                "a": "Yes. The main nights and Custom Night gradually increase in difficulty, and Custom Night allows you to manually adjust the challenge settings."
            },
            {
                "q": "Is there a time limit or countdown each night?",
                "a": "Yes. Each night has a fixed duration, and your goal is to survive until dawn."
            },
            {
                "q": "Are there easter eggs or hidden content?",
                "a": "Yes. The game includes hidden items and references to other Chaves-related fan horror games within its extra menus."
            },
            {
                "q": "How does Chaves Nightmares play on mobile?",
                "a": "If you enjoy survival horror focused on monitoring and resource management, Chaves Nightmares quickly pulls you in. The core mechanics include watching different areas through cameras or observation points, managing limited resources such as power, time, or actions, and making calm, fast decisions when threats appear—switching views, stopping an action, or waiting instead of panicking. On mobile, the tension is stronger because the screen is close to your face. You're not exploring an open space, but reading signals: a subtle change, a shadow that shouldn't exist, or a sound that arrives half a second late. The game often punishes you right when you think you've mastered its patterns."
            },
            {
                "q": "How is Chaves Nightmares different from other FNaF-style games?",
                "a": "Comparisons to Five Nights at Freddy's are inevitable, but the overall experience is noticeably different in three ways. First, it uses the contrast between nostalgia and horror, twisting a once friendly, lighthearted world into something deeply unsettling. Second, it emphasizes psychological horror over action horror, relying less on jump scares and more on anticipation, repetition, doubt, and the uncertainty of whether something just moved. Third, it has a strong fan-made identity: it doesn't aim to be massive in scale, but it feels personal and distinctive, which is why many players find it more authentic."
            },
            {
                "q": "Are the Android system requirements high? Can mid-range phones run it?",
                "a": "As a 2D horror game, Chaves Nightmares is generally more hardware-friendly than heavy 3D horror titles, and the requirements are not high. However, stability still depends on the specific build and optimization. For a better experience, close background apps before playing, use headphones—sound acts as a radar, not decoration—and play in a distraction-free environment, as the game punishes loss of focus."
